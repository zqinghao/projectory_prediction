# projectory_prediction
Projectory trajectory prediction based on multipe linear regression

# How to run
There are a python file and a jupyter notebook file whose contents are almost the same. Please run the .py file by

'python3 projectiles_prediction.py <inital_velocity_x> <initial_velocity_y>'

Note that the unit in this project is m/10ms, so if the input velocity is with the same unit, the value of position of the initial
point is the value of velocity here.
